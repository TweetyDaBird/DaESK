 DaESK is designed as an Ortholinear split keyboard with a detached thumb-key cluster, allowing a different angle/level of tent and positioning for the two parts.

 Key design features:
 * Full SMD design with onboard Atmega32u4 MCU compatible with QMK/TMK and other firmware suites.
 * Onboard IS31FL3737 RGB controller for full per-key adressable RGB matrix.
 * Cherry MX type keyswitches in Kaihl Hot-Swap sockets.
 * Mid-mounted USB-C connector for durability and low profile.
 * Dual sided reversible design, identical PCB and thumbcluster PCB for both halves.
 * Each half can work as a master/slave pair (TRRS/I2C link) and independently as a gamepad-type keyboard for the left/right hand without reprogramming.
 * Flexible thumbcluster design, supports 1-8 keys per side, connected by ribbon cable (Multiple designs will be available).
 
 Optional layouts:
 * DaESK-4R a ~60%, 4-Row (4x6 key) layout with 48 keys plus 2-16 key thumbcluster for a total of 50-64 keys.
 * DaESK-3R a ~40%, 3-Row (3x6 key) layout with 36 keys plus 2-16 key thumbcluster for a total of 38-52 keys.
 
 Planned features:
 * Already designed in mounting holes for a low profile FR4 midplate/backplate case design.
