 Licensed under CERN-OHL-S v2 or any later version.

 DaESK is designed as an Ortholinear split keyboard with a detached thumb-key cluster, allowing a different angle/level of tent and positioning for the two parts.

 Key design features:
 * Full SMD design with onboard Atmega32u4 MCU compatible with QMK/TMK and other firmware suites.
 * Onboard IS31FL3737 RGB controller for full per-key adressable RGB matrix with built in effects.
 * Cherry MX type keyswitches in Kaihl Hot-Swap sockets.
 * Mid-mounted USB-C connector for durability and low profile.
 * Dual sided reversible design, identical PCB and thumbcluster PCB for both halves.
 * Each half can work as a master/slave pair (TRRS/I2C link) and as a one-hand gamepad without reprogramming.
 * Flexible thumbcluster design, supports 1-8 keys per side, connected to main PCB with ribbon cable.
 
 Available main layouts:
 * DaESK-4R a ~60%, 4-Row (4x6 key) layout with 48 keys plus 2-16 key thumbcluster for a total of 50-64 keys.
 * DaESK-3R a ~40%, 3-Row (3x6 key) layout with 36 keys plus 2-16 key thumbcluster for a total of 38-52 keys.
 
 Available Thumbcluster layouts:
 * DaESK-TH1 an adaptable ErgoDox style thumbcluster with break-away parts.
 
 Planned features:
 * Already designed in mounting holes for a low profile FR4 midplate/backplate case design.
 * Multiple thumbcluster designs.
 
 Current Version:
 v0.9x - Almost ready for prototype PCB order
 
 ToDo:
 * DaESK-3R, USB-C
