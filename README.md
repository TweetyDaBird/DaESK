 DaESK is designed as an Ortholinear split keyboard with a detached thumb-key cluster, 
 meant to be placed in a different angle/plane than the main matrix, allowing one to tent and not the other.

 Key points:
 * Full SMD design with onboard Atmega32u4 and IS31FL3737 RGB matrix controller.
 * Compatible with QMK and various other keyboard Software suites.
 * Reversible PCB design, both the matrix PCB and thumb-cluster PCB can be used for each hand.
