 Licenced as CERN-OHL-S-2.0 or any later version.

 DaESK is designed as an Ortholinear split keyboard with a detached thumb-key cluster, 
 meant to be placed in a different angle/plane than the main matrix, allowing one to tent and not the other.

 Key points:
 * Full SMD design with onboard Atmega32u4 and IS31FL3737 RGB matrix controller.
 * Compatible with QMK and various other keyboard software suites.
 * Reversible design, using identical PCB for both sides.
 * Robust mid-mount USB-C connector and ESD protection circuit, I2C over TRRS to connect the two sides.
 * Kaihl Cherry MX type hot-swap sockets.
